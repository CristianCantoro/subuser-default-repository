The subuser default repository
==============================

This default repository is shared by all subuser instalations.  Its goal is to provide examples for developers, as well as to consolidate image bases to ensure that most subuser programs can be installed without too much wasted disk space.  All efforts will be made to keep this repository stable so that it is safe to base your subuser images on images found in this repository.  This repository contains only free software though some software may violate some or all of the innumerable software patents in whatever totalitarian hollywood hell-hole you come from.
